# Team

The Benefit Plan Standard is currently stewarded by a small group of individuals passionate about health data interoperability and open standards.  The founding team is responsible for the initial schema design, documentation, and community outreach.

## Founders

- **Diego Orofino** — Project founder and lead architect.  Diego is a health tech entrepreneur who envisioned a unified way to represent benefit plans after experiencing integration pain across carriers.  He drives the specification design and oversees the open source efforts.

Additional contributors will be listed here as the community grows.  We welcome new volunteers!

## Contributing

If you would like to join the team or contribute in any way (documentation, coding, outreach, governance), please reach out through the [contact page](contact.md) or open an issue on GitHub.  We especially encourage participation from:

- Carriers and TPAs
- Brokers and benefits consultants
- Employers and HR technology vendors
- Developers working on insurtech platforms

Together we can create a healthier and more transparent benefits ecosystem.
