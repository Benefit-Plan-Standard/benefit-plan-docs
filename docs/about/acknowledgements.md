# Acknowledgements

We would like to thank the many individuals and organizations who have contributed to the development of the Benefit Plan Standard.  Your support and feedback are invaluable.

## Early Reviewers

Several carriers, brokers and technology vendors provided invaluable feedback on the early drafts of the schema.  Their insights helped ensure that the standard addresses real‑world challenges.

## Community Contributors

This project is open source and community‑driven.  Thank you to everyone who reported issues, submitted pull requests, and participated in discussions.  Your contributions make the standard stronger.

## Inspiration

The work of other standards organizations—including HL7 FHIR, ACORD, OAuth and JSON Schema—has inspired our approach to openness and transparency.  We acknowledge the years of effort that went into building those ecosystems.

## Sponsors

We plan to recognize sponsors and supporters in future releases.  If you are interested in sponsoring the development of the Benefit Plan Standard or supporting the governance process, please contact us.
