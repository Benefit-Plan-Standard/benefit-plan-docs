# Compliance Certification

The Benefit Plan Standard offers a voluntary program for certifying carriers, brokers, TPAs, and vendors who wish to demonstrate full compliance.

Certification provides:

- Formal recognition on the website  
- Increased trust with customers  
- Verification of implementation quality  
- Reduced onboarding friction for integrations  

---

## Certification Levels

### **Level 1 — JSON Schema Certified**
Your plan files pass all structural validation checks.

### **Level 2 — Standard Vocabulary Certified**
Your implementation uses the standardized vocabulary, crosswalk mappings, and normalization logic.

### **Level 3 — Fully Normalized Portfolio Certified**
Your entire portfolio of benefit plans is consistently normalized and validated.

## Certification Process

1. **Submit examples**  
   Provide 3–5 normalized JSON plans.

2. **Automated validation**  
   We run the full suite against your submission.

3. **Manual edge-case review**  
   A human reviewer checks ambiguous or unusual structures.

4. **Approval + Badge**  
   You receive:
   - Certification badge
   - Listing on benefitplanstandard.org
   - Optional press announcement

## Annual Renewal

Certification must be renewed every year because:

- ACA/Medicare rules change  
- Carriers release new versions of plans  
- Vocabulary and modules evolve  

---

## Fees (optional, for business phase)

Once commercialized:
- Level 1 may remain free  
- Level 2+ may require an application fee
