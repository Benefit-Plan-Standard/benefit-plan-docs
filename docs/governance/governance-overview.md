# Governance Overview

Benefit Plan Standard operates as an open, community‑driven initiative.  To ensure the schema remains fair, transparent, and responsive to stakeholder needs, we follow a formal governance model.  This page summarises our mission, values, organizational structure, and decision‑making processes.

## Mission and Values

- **Interoperability:** Promote seamless data exchange across carriers, regulators, plan sponsors, and insurtech platforms.
- **Transparency:** Maintain open processes and public artefacts so all stakeholders understand how decisions are made.
- **Inclusivity:** Invite participation from carriers, technology vendors, healthcare providers, and consumer advocates.
- **Stability and Extensibility:** Provide a stable core while enabling new modules and fields as healthcare evolves.

## Organizational Structure

The project is stewarded by a **Working Group** that includes representatives from carriers, plan sponsors, benefit administrators, and technology providers.  Membership is open to any organization willing to commit time and expertise.

### Working Group Roles

- **Chair:** Facilitates meetings, sets agendas, ensures consensus, and represents the project externally.
- **Editors:** Maintain the schema and documentation; merge approved changes.
- **Contributors:** Submit proposals, comment on issues, and help author modules.
- **Observers:** Participate in discussions without voting rights.

## Decision‑Making Process

1. **Proposal:** Anyone may open a GitHub issue or pull request to propose a new module, field, or change.
2. **Discussion:** The Working Group reviews proposals during scheduled calls or via asynchronous discussion.  Stakeholders evaluate impact on backwards compatibility and industry needs.
3. **Drafting:** Editors refine accepted proposals into draft specifications and update the crosswalk, field definitions, and examples.
4. **Voting:** Changes affecting the core schema or existing modules require a majority vote of Working Group members.  Minor clarifications and documentation updates may be merged by Editors without a formal vote.
5. **Release:** Approved changes are incorporated into the next version (see Versioning & Release Policy).  A changelog entry and release notes are published.

## Meeting Schedule

Working Group calls occur monthly, with additional ad‑hoc meetings for urgent proposals.  Meeting notes and recordings are published in the `/docs/governance/` section and via the project’s public GitHub repository.

## Code of Conduct

We adhere to the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/).  Participants are expected to treat others with respect and to foster an environment free of discrimination and harassment.  Violations may result in removal from meetings or revocation of contributor rights.
